# TicTacToeTwist

Welcome to **TicTacToeTwist** — a fun twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe!

This project adds new features, creative gameplay variations, and improved design elements to make Tic-Tac-Toe even more exciting.
In this version, when you make your **fourth move**, your **first move gets deleted**, forcing you to rethink your strategy!  
The game also includes **3 difficulty settings** to challenge players of all skill levels, and a 2 player mode.

## Features

- 🎮 Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- 🌀 Unique twist rules or bonus mechanics (customizable)
- 🤖 Optional AI opponent (coming soon / implemented if applicable)
- 💻 Simple and clean Python code structure
- 🎨 Future plans for a graphical interface (optional)
